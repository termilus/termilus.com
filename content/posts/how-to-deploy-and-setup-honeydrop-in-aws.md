description: This guide details how to deploy and setup the HoneyDrop appliance
  in AWS. This appliance will expose fake services often targeted by cyber
  criminals. Its purpose is to lure attackers to itself thereby generating logs
  and alarms indicating that a nefarious actor may be on the network. When a
  HoneyDrop service is interacted with, the activity gets logged to AWS
  CloudWatch which can generate alerts to be sent to email or SMS.
  Alternatively, CloudWatch alarms can trigger Lambda functions to invoke
  incident response actions on your behalf.
